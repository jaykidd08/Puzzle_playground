  itemDescription: "There are many times in a game design where you\u2019ll need
    a program to run two different sections of code simultaneously. Normally code
    runs one line after the other until it reaches the end of the script and in the
    case of Unity when the update functions is used it will continuously call any
    code within the update function every frame which can be a big issue for performance.
    The way to solve both of these issues is to allow the update function to run
    a smaller portion of code and divert any code that won\u2019t be used regularly
    to a Coroutine which can be called using \u201CStartCoroutine(CoroutineName());\u201D
    which will then start running the code within the Coroutine while the update
    function is allowed to continue through any other code within the update function.
    The Coroutine above is looking for a line of code that matches \u201CIEnumerator
    CoroutineName()\u201D where it will now run everything within the Coroutine and
    can even apply waiting times to the code without stopping the rest of the game.
    Here is some example code from the Dimensional Goggles Script.\r\ngoggleOnCD
    = true;\r\nyield return new WaitForSeconds(goggleCD);\r\ngoggleOnCD = false;\r\nThis
    code simply sets the Boolean goggleOnCD to true then calls for the Coroutine
    to Wait a number of seconds set in the goggleCD variable. After the number of
    seconds has passed the program will now be allowed forward to reset the goggleOnCD
    Boolean to false.\r\n"
