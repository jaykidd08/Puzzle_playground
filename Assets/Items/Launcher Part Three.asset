  itemDescription: "private Queue<GameObject> platforms = new Queue<GameObject>();\r\nThe
    platforms variable is created as a Queue of GameObjects, which is like a line
    of objects that slowly grows following FIFO rules. As objects are dequeued from
    the line others behind it move forward to take its place. The PlatformManager
    script uses a Queue to keep track of the number of platforms currently spawned
    in and will keep the number from exceeding a maximum threshold. \n\r\n<indent
    = 60>if (platforms.Count >= maxPlatforms)\r\n{\r\n    GameObject oldPlatform
    = platforms.Dequeue();\r\n    Destroy(oldPlatform);\r\n}</indent>\n\r\nPlatforms.Count
    returns the number of GameObjects currently in the Queue which is then compared
    to the Int maxPlatforms to determine if the maximum number of platforms has been
    reached. Once the game tries to Spawn a platform, but the maxPlatforms is reached
    the first GameObject in the Queue is Dequeued with \u201Cplatforms.Dequeue();\u201D
    and the object is destroyed. \n\r\n<indent = 60>GameObject newPlatform = Instantiate(platformPrefab,
    spawnPosition, rotation);\r\nplatforms.Enqueue(newPlatform);</indent>\n\r\nAfterwards
    the new Platform that the game is trying to spawn is Instantiated from a prefab
    and \u201Cplatforms.Enqueue(newPlatform);\u201D is used to place the new platform
    at the end of the line queue;\r\n"
