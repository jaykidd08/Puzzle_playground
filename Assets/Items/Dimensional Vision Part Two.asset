  itemDescription: "public List<GameObject> dimensionalPlatforms;\r\nWithin the DimensionalShiftGoggles
    script this line of code creates a List of GameObjects that can be assigned in
    the inspector window. This allow for easy additions of new objects that need
    to be added to the dimensionalPlatforms array without the need of attaching a
    script to every object that must disappear for the googles to function properly.
    \r\nLater in the code this list is called using a foreach statement which will
    perform the same task on each GameObject that has been placed in the list dimensionalPlatforms.\r\n       
    foreach (GameObject platform in dimensionalPlatforms)\r\n        {\r\n           
    if (platform != null)\r\n            {\r\n                platform.SetActive(toggle);\r\n           
    }\r\n        }\r\nThe statement takes each GameObject in the list and uses a
    Boolean to set the active state of the object to the opposite of what it was
    previously. \r\n"
