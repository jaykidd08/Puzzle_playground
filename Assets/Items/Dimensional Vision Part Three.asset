  itemDescription: "With the use of the list and coroutine features the Dimensional
    Goggles turn into a very simple to code gameplay mechanic, so the last piece
    of this tool will be a tip for keeping the inspector window well organized and
    easy to read. With the many scripts that can end up attached to an object as
    well as different variables that can be set in the inspector window, it would
    be helpful to have section titles to categorize the variables to make finding
    the correct variable easier. This can be achieved by using a \u201CHeader\u201D
    which creates a bold text in the inspector window which can be used to break
    up variables. \r\nEX:\r\nPublic GameObject simpleCrate;\r\n[Header(\u201CSection
    Title Here\u201D)]\r\nPublic List<GameObject> listOfObjects;\r\nThis would create
    a section break that looks similar to this\r\n\r\nsimpleCrate[crate 1]\r\n\r\nSection
    Title Here\r\nlistOfObjects[listObject1]\r\n"
