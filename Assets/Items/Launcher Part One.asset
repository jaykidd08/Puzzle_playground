  itemDescription: "\tInstantiate is useful for creating objects that are not present
    when a scene first starts, especially when you need to spawn multiple copies
    during gameplay. Common uses include generating collectable items, creating enemies
    over time, or firing projectiles like the one in this launcher example. \n\tYou
    start by creating a variable of the appropriate type and giving it a descriptive
    name. In this case, we\u2019re creating a 3D object in the player\u2019s world,
    so I\u2019ve made the type GameObject, and we name it projectile to keep the
    naming scheme clear. \n\tNext, we initialize that variable using the Instantiate()
    method, which is built into the Unity Engine. In this example, Instantiate()
    takes three arguments. \n<indent=60>1. The first argument is a reference to the
    GameObject prefab that was initialized earlier in the script. launcherAmmo is
    a public GameObject that will be assigned with an appropriate prefab in the inspector
    window.\n2. The second argument defines where the new object will spawn. The
    script uses attackPoint.position, which refers to an empty GameObject placed
    at the tip of the launcher model in the scene view. The .position property returns
    a Vector3 containing the X, Y, and Z coordinates of that Transform\u2019s positn.
    \n3. The third argument sets the rotation of the spawned object. In this case,
    cam.rotation provides a Quaternion that matches the player camera\u2019s current
    orientation, ensuring the projectile launches in the direction the player is
    facing. </indent>"
