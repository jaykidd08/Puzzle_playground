  itemDescription: "public void OnCollisionEnter (Collision col) {           }\n\r\nOnCollisionEnter
    is a built in unity Method that is automatically called when two objects with
    Rigidbody component collide with one another. The variable col can provide various
    different pieces of information about the object that is being collided with
    and as such can be used in many ways. \r\nEx: \r\n<indent = 60>1: col.collider.tag
    \u2013 Returns the tag of the object which can be used to compare to a matching
    tag \r\n2: col.contacts[0].point  - Returns the exact position where the col
    object made contact with another object.\r\n3: col.rigidbody.AddForce() \u2013
    Can be used to add force to an object when collisions is made allowing the game
    to add additional forces beyond normal velocities. This is useful in cases where
    the game needs to simulate explosions\r\nThis a just a portion of what can be
    gathered from the OnCollisionEnter() method and some examples of what is used
    to make this tool. The Platform Launcher tool uses the \u201Ccollider.tag\u201D
    and \u201CContacts[0].point\u201D to check if the projectile has collided with
    an object that has the tag \u201CPlatfromWall\u201D and if so, calls a method
    in the PlatformManager script to create an instance of a platform at the contact
    point between the projectile and the object that it has collided with.\n\r\nif
    (collision.collider.tag == \"PlatformWall\")\r\n {\r\n     ContactPoint platformPoint
    = collision.contacts[0];\r\n     Vector3 normal = platformPoint.normal;\r\n    
    PlatformManager.Instance.SpawnPlatform(platform, platformPoint.point, normal);\r\n}</indent>\r\n"
